Differential Expression Analysis of TNBC between African American and Caucasian Subjects

We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes in TNBC between African Americans and Caucasian TNBC patients to provide insight into gene dysregulation in TNBC and potential precision therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.  

Genes expression profiles of GSE142731 and GPL16791 were retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142731 (NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)). 

Data analysis was done using Deseq2 package in Bioconductor and R programming language.
